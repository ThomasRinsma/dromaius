GameBoy Emulator

This is a little project that tries to be a working Nintendo GameBoy (DMG) emulator. It will probably never be complete and it is mostly just a learning experience for me.

I'm using some code and mostly ideas from other projects. I hope to be able to rewrite those parts once I feel like I fully understand them.

As of now (r 4), not much is working. There's some test roms I've found which I've been using to test parts of the emulator. Most of them don't even start up correctly right now. The roms are not mine, if any of them are yours, and you don't want me to host it here, please say so.

For any questions or anything whatsoever, please send me an email :)
